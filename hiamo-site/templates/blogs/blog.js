              The HMS New Zealand was scrapped in 1922, only 10 years after entering service and 23
              years before the New Zealand government would finish paying back the purchase in 1945
              <sup>[4]</sup>
              . The 4-inch secondary guns were brought to Aotearoa for the final time, where they
              were used as saluting guns in Auckland and Wellington for over 10 years.
              <br />
              <br />
              Eventually, the 4-inch guns were placed in coastal defence roles around the country
              <sup>[5]</sup>
              . Four were used in Wellington, and these are the ones we have focussed
              on the most. They were first emplaced inside the Oruaiti reserve at Fort Dorsetâ€™s Gap
              Battery, where the original emplacements can still be seen
              <sup>[5][6]</sup>
              . These were intended to guard the harbour entrance but, luckily, they never had to.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over time the 4-inch guns were modified in numerous ways, receiving better sights to
              aim and shields to protect the crews operating them. Seatoun residents had to put up
              with multiple test firings of the guns for training during the Second World War,
              something which is surely not missed now. Two of the guns were moved to Fort Ballance
              above Scorching Bay
              <sup>[6]</sup>
              , but the threat of invasion had already decreased.
              <br />
              <br />
              After the war ended the 4-inch guns had lost their purpose, and most of them were
              scrapped during the 1950s-60s. Two examples remain outside the Auckland War Memorial
              Museum, although they have lost many pieces over time
              <sup>[7]</sup>
              .
